<h1>Linear Regression:</h1>
<b> When it is asked to predict: some classifications like predict tsunami or not-tsunami, hacked or not-hacked. then these fall under classification. Because we have classes here.</b>
</br>
<b> If it was asked about the numbers like. predict tsunami magnitude, amount hacked, number of customers hacked etc</b>
 </br>
 <b> How to identify the type of problems</b>
 </br></br>
Question: You are an analyst at SBI Bank and recently discovered customer accounts to be hacked.

So you want to create software that categorizes each customer's account as hacked or safe.

Which machine learning task will be helpful in this particular task?
</br>
Answer: Classification
<li>Since the accounts will be categorized as hacked or un-hacked i.e. classified into categories/ classes. Hence, it is a classification problem.</li>

<li>If it were asked to predict the amount lost by each customer then it would have been a regression problem.</li>

<li>If it were asked to group customers by income so as to understand if there is any pattern behind hacking then it would have been a clustering problem.</li>

<li>Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones and is hence not applicable.</li>
